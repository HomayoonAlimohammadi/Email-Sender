Dear Professor ;allkdj,  
  
My name is Nooshin Rajabi. I am studying the last semester of B.Sc. in
Materials Science and Engineering at **Sharif University of Technology** ,
Tehran, Iran. with the last two yearsâ€™ **GPA** of **3.8** /4.0 with a
**TOEFL** (iBT) score of **108** /120. I have participated in a number of
projects involving the use of **machine learning** and **deep learning** in
materials science as one of the department's pioneers.  
My research interest and experience are compatible with your work on Additive
Manufacturing. The information offered in your publications, such as **"First
Paper"** (2020) and **"Second Paper"** (2022) is incredibly helpful.  
It would be a great opportunity for me to pursue the path of research for
M.Sc. in fall 2023 under your supervision at Tennesi. I would really
appreciate your reply about the possibility of joining your research group.  
I attached my CV and you can also visit my [website](nooshinrajabi.github.io).
Should you need any additional information, please do not hesitate to let me
know.  
  
Best regards,  
Nooshin Rajabi
